Justin Ewing
Graham Culver
Colin Peter
Jyotsna Prakash
Rene Isais

Release 10.21.15-0.1-10.26.15

Postmortem:
Justin was able to setup a personal django server to serve as the basis of the Sprint 2 iteration
Graham created the index.html & site.css files located in the soundstash github to serve as a proof of concept
Jyotsna created sounds.xml and recorded everyone's 5 song submission to serve as the placeholder data store
Colin & Rene contributed to the planning of the project and independently researched pertinent technologies
Everyone worked together to create the Scrum board, agree upon an acceptable UI scheme, and perform detailed design

Retrospective:
Not all the tasks we set out to complete were performed, due to an initial discrepency in expectations and a general
hesitation with regard to how the project should be carried out. This may have been the result of not formally having
a group until well into the first sprint and not having a Scrum board until a week after that. Individually and collectively
we have decided to ramp up efforts for Sprints 2 & 3 to ensure the final product we present at the end of this quarter
full reflects our own expectations and capabilities.
