Release 10.21.15-0.1-10.26.15

Goal: The goal of this sprint was to put together the skeleton of our service and further define, conceptually, what we wanted our service to have. This included getting a local server set up, having a basic html website with static links, and having a small dataset of links to music for internal verification.
